            <h2>Webmasters Hackathon Submission</h2>
            <h5>Project for the IUPUI Computer Science Club, Feb 19, 2023</h5>
            <div class="pic" style="height:200px;"><img src="club_logo.png"></div>
            <p>On Feb 13th, I started a project for IUPUI's Computer Science Club event. The event is called Webmasters Hackathon. Even though I am not majoring in computer science, I wanted to participate. Though I am very inexperienced in HTML and CSS, I thought it would be a great experience. I am only in my sixth week of CIT212 Webpage Design, but I am starting to feel more confident. This webpage is my submission for the event. It has been alot of fun, and I learned some new skills. Some things I learned in CSS include the grid layout, float, display, clear, content, and box-sizing. I also learned some positioning techniques. Having a specific time frame has pushed me to complete the project, and I appreciate that. This webpage is part of my submission. I plan to continue to improve the content as my skills improve. I will also host it on my domain soon. Even if I do not get recognized for my work, it has been a good experience.</p>

            <h2>Centuries of Presidents</h2>
            <h5>A small HTML and CSS project, Feb 15, 2023</h5>
            <div class="pic" style="height:200px;"><img src="georgewashington.jpg"></div>
            <p>This week in CIT212 I did an assignment where I was tasked with making a webpage with a presidential theme. I learned how to use semantic tags: header, nav, article, aside, and footer. I also created an external style sheet to ensure the look of the webpages was cohesive. Like my other projects, I posted it to GitHub. You can see the HTML and CSS I created <a href="https://github.com/NolanPatterson/centuriesofpresidents" target="_blank">here</a> on GitHub.</p>
